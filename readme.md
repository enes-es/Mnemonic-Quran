The development structure in mind is as follows (subject to heavy changes)

* Developing a terminal program for Major System for number memorization
  * Prepare software requirements
    * Create epics, user stories, tasks and assign worktime
  * Design OOP code structure
  * Write unit test cases
  * Implement
  * Apply unit tests
* Developing a Quran sub-section mnemonic divisor and storer API, terminal output.
  * Prepare software requirements
    * Create epics, user stories, tasks and assign worktime
